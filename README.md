# Energy-Consumption-Patterns-of-Nations
This Power BI project analyzes global energy consumption patterns. Data was cleaned using Python, focusing on metrics like electricity access, renewable energy, and CO2 emissions. Visualizations provide actionable insights for policymakers and researchers.
# Energy Consumption Patterns of Nations

## Project Overview
This project explores global energy consumption patterns using Power BI for visualization. Python was utilized for data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency. Insights include electricity access, renewable energy usage, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency across various nations.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Null values managed, columns with >50% missing data removed using Python.
- **Analysis Dimensions**: 
  - Access to electricity and clean cooking fuels.
  - Renewable energy share in total energy consumption.
  - Carbon emissions and energy intensity trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Developed in Power BI for deeper exploration.
